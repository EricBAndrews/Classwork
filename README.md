# Classwork

This repository holds all the classwork I've been able to find.

Unfortunately my work from Boston University's CS1 and Computer Systems courses and the computer they were on are AWOL at the moment, but I still have all my Java from CS2 (yay?).

*IF YOU ARE A COMPUTER SCIENCE STUDENT AT FRANKLIN & MARSHALL OR BOSTON UNIVERSITY, I STRONGLY SUGGEST YOU LOOK AWAY NOW*
