# Classwork

This repository holds all the classwork I still have that I'm allowed to share (academic honesty and all that).

Unfortunately my work from Boston University's CS1 and Computer Systems courses were lost with the computer they were on, but I still have all my Java from CS2 (yay?)

I'm still working with the Franklin & Marshall CS department to figure out when/how I can put up my code from CS3 and Parallel Computing.
